1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.`,
